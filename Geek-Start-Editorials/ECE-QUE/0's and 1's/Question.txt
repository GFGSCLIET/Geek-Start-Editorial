A kid is confused with bit manipulation. help him in solving this problem. you are given an Integer N, and print the inverted bits of the actual given number.

Input Format

The 1st line consists of Number N.
Constraints

0 <= N <= 10^4
Output Format

print the reversed bits of the actual given number.

Sample Input 0

10
Sample Output 0

0101
Explanation 0

The binary value of 10 is 1010.
so, the resultant inversion of 1010 is 0101.
Sample Input 1

0
Sample Output 1

1
Explanation 1
